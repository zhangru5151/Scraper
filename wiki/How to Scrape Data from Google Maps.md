## What is a Google Maps Scraper?

A Google Maps scraper is a powerful tool designed to extract detailed information from Google Maps, including:

- Locations and geographic coordinates
- Names and contact information
- Reviews and ratings

Compared to using the Google Places API, a scraper provides a more efficient way to extract bulk data. You can search by keywords, coordinates, or URLs to collect data from specific locations, cities, or entire regions.

## How to Create a Google Maps Scraper

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll scrape restaurant data from New York City on Google Maps using the **Crawlbase API** and **PHP**. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Obtain the Request URL

First, search for "restaurants in New York" on Google Maps. The restaurant data appears in the sidebar on the left. To extract this data, inspect the browserâ€™s network traffic to locate the relevant URL.

1. Right-click on the sidebar and select **Inspect**.
2. Open the **Network** tab in the developer tools section.
3. Filter the requests by typing "search" to find the URL that retrieves the data.

Once identified, click the relevant request and copy its URL from the **Headers** tab. This URL will serve as the basis for our scraping logic.

Example URL:
```
https://www.google.com/search?tbm=map&q=New+York+restaurants
```

### Step 2: Analyze the Returned Data

Using the extracted URL, weâ€™ll send a GET request and analyze the returned JSON data. 

1. Encode the URL using `urlencode()` in PHP.
2. Use the Crawlbase token for authentication.
3. Send a request to the Crawlbase API and view the returned data.

### Step 3: Create the Scraping Logic

Hereâ€™s how to process the returned data:

1. Remove unnecessary characters to format the response as valid JSON.
2. Decode the JSON into a PHP array.
3. Loop through the array to extract restaurant information like name, location, and contact details.

### Sample PHP Code

Below is a simple PHP script to scrape restaurant data from Google Maps using the Crawlbase API:

```php
<?php

// Crawlbase API token
$token = "YOUR_CRAWLBASE_TOKEN";

// Google Maps search URL
$google_maps_url = "https://www.google.com/search?tbm=map&q=New+York+restaurants";

// Encode the URL
$encoded_url = urlencode($google_maps_url);

// Build the Crawlbase API request
$request_url = "https://api.crawlbase.com/?token=$token&url=$encoded_url";

// Initialize cURL session
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $request_url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

// Execute the request
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

// Decode the JSON response
$response_data = substr($response, 4); // Remove extra characters
$response_data = str_replace("null", "\"\"", $response_data);
$scraped_data = json_decode($response_data, true);

// Extract restaurant information
foreach ($scraped_data['data'] as $restaurant) {
    $name = $restaurant[11]; // Name of the restaurant
    $location = $restaurant[18]; // Location
    $phone = $restaurant[178]; // Contact number
    
    echo "Name: $name\n";
    echo "Location: $location\n";
    echo "Phone: $phone\n\n";
}
?>
```
