## Two Main Types of Market Research Data

There are two primary ways to collect market research data: **primary data** and **secondary data**.

### Primary Data

Primary data refers to information collected firsthand, directly from sources. It is often more reliable and accurate. Generally, primary data can be divided into **qualitative data** and **quantitative data**.

#### Qualitative Primary Data

This type of data includes textual and visual information obtained through direct investigation. Common methods for gathering qualitative data include:

- Brainstorming
- Focus group discussions
- Key informant interviews
- Observation methods

#### Quantitative Primary Data

Quantitative data refers to numerical information. One of the most common methods for obtaining this data is through surveys, where investigators use standardized questionnaires to collect responses.
