# 10 Proven Ways to Get Your Website Indexed by Google

If Google hasnâ€™t indexed your website, itâ€™s practically invisible. You wonâ€™t appear in any search results or gain any organic traffic.

Since youâ€™re here, you likely understand how critical this issue is. Letâ€™s dive straight into how to resolve it.

In this article, weâ€™ll address how to solve three common indexing problems:

1. Your entire site isnâ€™t indexed.
2. Some pages are indexed while others arenâ€™t.
3. New pages arenâ€™t being indexed promptly.

## What Does Google Indexing Mean?

Google indexes your website through a process called crawling. Crawling involves Googleâ€™s bot, known as **Googlebot**, scanning your site for content and adding it to their index. Here are some key terms you need to understand:

- **Crawling**: Following links on webpages to discover new content.
- **Indexing**: Storing webpages in Googleâ€™s massive database.
- **Web Crawler**: A program that performs crawling.
- **Googlebot**: Googleâ€™s specific web crawler.

When you search on Google, the results you see come from its index. Google then uses algorithms to rank pages based on their relevance and quality.

> **Key Insight**: Indexing and ranking are separate processes. Indexing is participating; ranking is winning. You canâ€™t rank if youâ€™re not indexed.

## How to Check If Your Website Is Indexed

To see if your website is indexed, search Google using the query:

```plaintext
site:yourwebsite.com
```

The number displayed represents an approximate count of indexed pages. If you want to check a specific page, search:

```plaintext
site:yourwebsite.com/page-url
```

If there are no results, the page hasnâ€™t been indexed.

Alternatively, you can use **Google Search Console** to get precise indexing data. Navigate to:

**Google Search Console > Index > Coverage**

Here, youâ€™ll see how many pages are indexed, how many have warnings, and how many arenâ€™t indexed.

> **Pro Tip**: If youâ€™re not using Google Search Console, sign up for it immediately. Itâ€™s an essential tool for any website owner serious about getting organic traffic.

## 10 Ways to Get Indexed on Google

If your website or pages arenâ€™t indexed, follow these steps:

### 1. Request Indexing in Google Search Console

To index a specific page:

1. Open **Google Search Console**.
2. Go to the **URL Inspection Tool**.
3. Paste the URL you want to index.
4. Click **Request Indexing**.

This works well for new pages but may not resolve indexing issues for older ones.

---

### 2. Remove Crawling Blocks in Robots.txt

If your entire site isnâ€™t indexed, it could be due to restrictions in your **robots.txt** file. Visit:

`yourwebsite.com/robots.txt`

Ensure you donâ€™t have the following rules:

```plaintext
User-agent: Googlebot
Disallow: /
```

or

```plaintext
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

If you find these, remove them. For individual pages blocked by robots.txt, use the URL Inspection Tool in Google Search Console to check for issues.

---

### 3. Eliminate Noindex Tags

Pages with a **noindex** directive wonâ€™t be indexed by Google. Check for these tags in the pageâ€™s `<head>` section:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
```

or

```html
<meta name="googlebot" content="noindex">
```

If present, remove the noindex tag to allow indexing.

---

### 4. Add Pages to Your Sitemap

A sitemap helps Google understand which pages are important on your site. If a page isnâ€™t in your sitemap, Google may not prioritize indexing it.

Use **Google Search Console** to confirm if a page is in your sitemap. If not, add it and ping Google using this URL format:

```plaintext
http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=your-sitemap-url
```

---

### 5. Address Canonical Tag Issues

Canonical tags indicate the preferred version of a page. If a page incorrectly points to another URL as the canonical version, it wonâ€™t be indexed. Check for this in Google Search Consoleâ€™s URL Inspection Tool and fix any misconfigured canonical tags.

---

### 6. Avoid Orphan Pages

Orphan pages are pages without any internal links pointing to them. Since Google discovers content through links, these pages may remain undiscovered.

Use tools like **Ahrefs Site Audit** to identify orphan pages and add internal links to them.

---

### 7. Fix Nofollow Internal Links

Internal links with the `nofollow` attribute prevent Google from crawling the linked pages. Ensure all important pages are linked with **follow** links.

---

### 8. Focus on Unique and Valuable Content

Google prioritizes indexing pages that provide value to users. Thin or low-quality pages are often ignored. Review your content and ask:

- Is this content helpful and relevant to users?
- Does it provide unique insights?

If the answer is no, improve the content before requesting indexing.

---

### 9. Remove Low-Quality Pages

Low-quality pages waste Googleâ€™s crawl budget. Remove unnecessary pages to help Google focus on indexing valuable content.

---

### 10. Build High-Quality Backlinks

Backlinks signal to Google that a page is important. The more high-quality backlinks you have, the faster Google will index your page. Focus on building links from authoritative sites to improve indexing and ranking.

---

## Indexing â‰  Ranking

Just because a page is indexed doesnâ€™t mean it will rank or attract traffic. Ranking requires optimizing pages for specific keywords through SEO.

SEO involves:

- Identifying target keywords.
- Creating high-quality, keyword-optimized content.
- Building backlinks.
- Keeping your content fresh and updated.

## Final Thoughts

Google may not index your website or pages for two reasons:

1. Technical issues prevent indexing.
2. The content lacks value or uniqueness.

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can resolve most indexing problems. However, remember that indexing is just the first step. To attract traffic, you need to focus on SEO to rank for relevant keywords.
