# Web Crawling with Python: A Comprehensive Guide

Web crawling is an essential technique for collecting data from the web by exploring and retrieving URLs across one or more domains. Python offers several popular libraries and frameworks for web crawling that simplify this process significantly.

In this article, weâ€™ll cover the basics of web crawling, explore the different strategies and use cases, and build a simple web crawler from scratch using Python. Weâ€™ll also demonstrate why frameworks like Scrapy are better suited for large-scale crawling and create an example Scrapy crawler for IMDb. Finally, weâ€™ll discuss best practices for scaling your crawls effectively.

## What is a Web Crawler?

[Web crawling](https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/scraping-vs-crawling/) and web scraping are related yet distinct concepts. While web scraping focuses on extracting specific data from web pages, web crawling is the underlying process of discovering and visiting URLs.

A web crawler starts with a list of URLs, known as the **seed**. It visits each URL, identifies links within the HTML, filters them based on predefined criteria, and adds the new links to a queue. The crawler can either extract all the HTML or just specific data for further processing.

Most web crawlers only visit a subset of pages, as the process is often constrained by factors like execution time, maximum depth, or a budget for pages per domain. Many websites provide a `robots.txt` file to indicate which areas of the website can be crawled, alongside an optional `sitemap.xml` file, which explicitly lists URLs for crawling.

### Common Web Crawler Use Cases:
- **Search Engines**: Tools like Googlebot and Bingbot index vast portions of the web for searchability.
- **SEO Analytics**: Platforms collect metadata, response statuses, and link structures to detect broken pages and track backlinks.
- **Price Monitoring**: E-commerce crawlers periodically revisit product pages to track pricing changes.
- **Open Data Projects**: Organizations like [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org) maintain repositories of publicly available web data.

## Building a Simple Web Crawler in Python

To build a basic web crawler, you need two key components: 
1. A library to perform HTTP requests.
2. A library to parse HTML and extract links.

### Standard Libraries: `urllib` and `html.parser`
Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries, like `urllib` and `html.parser`, can be used to create a simple crawler. However, they require more manual effort for robust crawling.

### Third-Party Libraries: `Requests` and `Beautiful Soup`
Popular libraries like [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io) and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) provide a more intuitive and efficient developer experience.

Hereâ€™s an architecture overview of a basic crawler:
- **`download_url`**: Fetch HTML using Requests.
- **`get_linked_urls`**: Extract links using Beautiful Soup.
- **`add_url_to_visit`**: Manage the queue of URLs to visit.

The crawler processes URLs in the queue, extracts new links from the HTML, and adds them back to the queue. This process continues until all URLs are visited.

```bash
python crawler.py
```

### Limitations of Basic Crawlers
- **Performance**: Crawlers are slow without parallelism.
- **URL Filtering**: Lack of robust mechanisms to handle duplicate or relative URLs.
- **Compliance**: No support for `robots.txt` or user-agent identification.

## Web Crawling with Scrapy

[Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy) is a powerful Python framework for web scraping and crawling, with features like asynchronous requests, robust settings, and customizable pipelines.

### Key Features of Scrapy
- **Asynchronous Requests**: Allows concurrent processing, improving performance significantly.
- **Spider & Pipeline Architecture**: Extract data with spiders and load it into storage via pipelines.
- **Middleware**: Add custom processing logic at different stages of the request/response cycle.

![Scrapy Architecture Overview](https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/crawling-python/image2.png)

### Example: Building an IMDb Scrapy Crawler
1. Create a Scrapy project using `startproject`.
2. Define a spider with custom rules for extracting links using `LinkExtractor`.
3. Use the `parse_item` method to process and store extracted data.

Run the crawler:
```bash
scrapy crawl imdb --logfile imdb.log -o imdb.jl -t jsonlines
```

### Handling Complex Scenarios
- **Duplicate URLs**: Use URL cleaners like `url_query_cleaner` from the `w3lib` library.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Use libraries like `extruct` to extract Open Graph and JSON-LD metadata.
- **Rate Limiting**: Configure Scrapyâ€™s settings to limit the number of concurrent requests.

## Web Crawling at Scale

When crawling large websites like IMDb (130M+ pages), itâ€™s essential to:
- Optimize Scrapyâ€™s [settings](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html).
- Adjust the crawl strategy (e.g., depth-first vs. breadth-first).
- Limit crawl budgets with settings like `CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT`.

Distributed crawls can speed up data collection significantly. For example, [a developer crawled 250M pages](https://michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-to-crawl-a-quarter-billion-webpages-in-40-hours/) using multiple EC2 instances in under two days.

For websites with JavaScript-heavy content, consider using tools like [ScrapingBeeâ€™s API](https://www.scrapingbee.com/features/data-extraction) for rendering JavaScript pages.

## Conclusion

We explored Python-based web crawling, comparing the simplicity of basic scripts with the advanced capabilities of frameworks like Scrapy. Scrapy stands out for its scalability and extensibility, making it ideal for complex crawling projects.

If youâ€™re just starting, try building a crawler for a small website. As you scale, youâ€™ll encounter challenges that deepen your understanding of the field. For large-scale web scraping without hassle, consider using a reliable tool like [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=coupons).
