# [GUI Software] Use YouTube API to Collect Keyword Search Results with an Easy-to-Use Interface!

## Background Introduction

### Objective

Hello, I‚Äôm [@È©¨Âì•pythonËØ¥](https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/user/5690870/articles?from_column=20421&from=20421), a software engineer with 10 years of experience. 

I developed a Python-based scraping tool that collects search results from YouTube by keywords. The tool extracts 14 critical fields:

- Keyword
- Page Number
- Video Title
- Video ID
- Video URL
- Publish Time
- Video Duration
- Channel Name
- Channel ID
- Channel URL
- View Count
- Like Count
- Comment Count
- Video Description

This software leverages YouTube's official API instead of web scraping, ensuring high stability. If you‚Äôre interested, check out this [step-by-step guide](https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/2414978?from_column=20421&from=20421) on enabling the YouTube API (YouTube Data API v3).

To make it accessible to non-coders, the tool is developed as a GUI software. No Python installation or code editing is required‚Äîjust double-click and use!

Here‚Äôs a preview of the tool‚Äôs interface:

## API Integration Explained

### Search API

The software retrieves data via the YouTube Search API. Below is an example of the JSON response:

**Steps:**

1. Define the API endpoint URL for requests.
2. Set up request headers to simulate a browser.
3. Add query parameters for search filters.

### Video Details API

The software also utilizes the Video Details API to retrieve more detailed information. Example JSON response:

**Steps:**

1. Define the API endpoint for video details.
2. Simulate browser headers for requests.
3. Send the request, receive data, and parse fields like "View Count" or "Likes."

The results are saved incrementally to CSV files, preventing data loss due to unexpected interruptions.

### API Key Configuration

The **API_KEY** is required to access YouTube‚Äôs official API. Once obtained, it needs to be added to the `config.json` file:
